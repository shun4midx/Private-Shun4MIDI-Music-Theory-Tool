Basic:
 - Supports **Circle of 4ths/5ths lookup** beginning at any note/key
 - Supports the instant recall of the notes in the scale and its key signature in **any scale of any mode**. If unspecified which "minor" scale is used, the natural (Aeolian), harmonic, and melodic minor would all be mentioned.
 - Supports the calculation of any interval between notes, remember to specify carefully which octave the two notes are!
 - [FOR FUN]: The Lick/Rickroll/Bad Apple can be transposed to any key and can be outputed any time üòÇ

Chords:
 - The user can input any chord name with **any chord extensions** (e.g. `Cmaj7b13`), and the desired inversion and/or slash chord, to output the chord to be displayed. Any chord in natural text form (i.e. not staff lines) would output in the order from the lowest to highest note in the chord. The input is straightforward, resembling normal text. Extended or altered dominants are supported.
 - The user can input any chord (with any chord extensions), except with the **note names only** (e.g. `C E G Ab B`), and the program can display the chord in staff line-notation and also **analyze the chord** (e.g. deduce this is a Cmaj7b13 chord). I plan to support different forms of harmony as indicated below with this, so e.g. `C F Bb` is interpreted as "C major quartal" and not some very obscure chord naming that doesn't reflect what this chord does. Extended or altered dominants are supported.
 - The user can check if any chord is in any scale or not, and if it is, which chord in the scale is it?
 - Suggests typical chord progression suggestions/auto-completion
 - Supports to **automatically voice-lead** any given chord progression
 - Supports to display the **modulation** of any chord into the tonic chord of any scale!
 - Supports to suggest a resolution from any chord to another
 - Supports for the user to suggest which chord they may want to borrow in a modulation

Alternate Harmony:
 - Support for **quartal harmony** üòé (Quartal chord generation based on a root note, any inversion of quartal chords, modal interchange of quartal chords, "Given a (custom) scale or short musical excerpt, how many quartal chords can I generate with notes purely diatonic to the scale excerpt?", etc)
 - Support for **whole-tone harmony** üòç (Whole-tone chord generation based on a root note, any inversion of whole-tone chords, modal interchange from other modes by weaving in whole-tone harmony if desired, etc)
 - Support for **Japanese pentatonic scales** (Y≈ç-sen/ÈôΩÊóã or In-sen/Èô∞Êóã as selected by the user). More will be revealed when the code is done, but let's just say it blends really well with quartal harmony as a new hybrid of **"J-Pentatonic Harmony" (coined by me, 2025)**, if I can get it worked out, which I'm 90% sure I can üëÄ The main idea of what I will offer is modulation between any Y≈ç-sen and In-sen scale, and also some things that are related to hybrid and quartal harmony in these scales (which I call J-Pentatonic Harmony), that I can't yet reveal, since they are relatively new concepts that I don't doubt I may be one of the first to actually document.
 - (*) Support for the inputing of **custom scales/solf√®ge** for analysis, although for the C++ code it will only last for one "Run" attempt and reset afterwards. As of right now, I only support the inputing into a Western-notation equivalent. It will support microtonal notation too. I'm not diving into microtonal harmony at least for the Shun4MIDI Music Theory Tool, but this would be only natural to preserve authenticity of custom scales. There will be an option to include a different rising and falling scale! Transposition of these scales to different starting keys are supported, and visiual representation is offered. When inputed a melody in solf√®ge of a custom scale, basic suggestions with vibrato and gliding will be supported.
