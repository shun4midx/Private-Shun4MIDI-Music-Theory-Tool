[SEMI-OFFICIAL SPEC DOCUMENT]

What if we make the OOP WesternMain, Quartal, WholeTone, Japanese, and Custom? Then another "Jingles" (Rickroll/The Lick/Bad Apple)? Also where do I do the "away from concert piano" thing and instrument...

class Manip {
    class NoteManip {
        class Scales 

        class Intervals

    protected:
        unordered_map key_offsets; // Maps string name of instrument to key_offset
    }

    class ChordManip {
        
    }
}

class MusicalPhrase {
public:
    // Treat the following below as if ConcertPhrase is a Handle class for classes of different genre classes WesternMain, Quartal, WholeTone, Japanese, Custom, and Jingles

    class ConcertPhrase {
        class Note

        class Chord <- stores chords as vectors stacking from root to upward

        class Key

    protected:
    // ======== FUNCTIONS ======== // 
        ostream print;
        *insert all the other functions corresponding to each functionality of the tool*, maybe deal with it with Manipulation class
    }

protected:
// ======== VARIABLES ======== // 
    string instrument_name;
    int instrument_offset; // Number of semitomes offset from concert key, negative meaning below, positive meaning above

// ======== FUNCTIONS ======== // 
    ostream print; // Create a new ConcertPhrase, transpose it (make sure to remain keyless for custom input and not change the SolfÃ¨ge) and then, call ConcertPhrase's ostream print
    ConcertPhrase& concertify() // Returns concert key equivalent
}

class UserIO // Used to greet and declare commands and stuff 

---------------------------
Okay, we should divide up the code to see which part of which code needs which class
 
This part would not include the specific functions and stuff, just the bare bone and where each part belongs?
